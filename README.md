# Blixt - React & Node.js

## Live demo 

Note that the project spins down with inactivity, so it might take 50 seconds before everything is running


### 💡 What I have learnt 
While building Blixt, I deepened my understanding of both backend and frontend technologies:

- I worked extensively with Supabase Auth to manage user authentication. This included implementing sign-up, login, and session persistence, while ensuring secure access to protected routes.

- For image and media uploads, I integrated Cloudinary, learning how to handle cloud-based storage and dynamically serve optimized images throughout the app.

- On the frontend, I explored new UI tools such as:

- Dnd Kit for creating smooth, flexible drag-and-drop interactions—especially useful in rearranging UI elements.

- Framer Motion to implement fluid transitions and animations, making the user experience more dynamic and responsive.

This project pushed me to build a fully interactive and scalable application, combining real-time functionality with modern UI/UX techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

Blixt is a modern, full-stack social media web application that replicates the core functionality of Instagram, while adding powerful enhancements for a rich user experience. Users can share photos, videos, and GIFs, interact through likes and comments, follow each other, and personalize their profiles—making Blixt a sleek and social alternative to traditional photo-sharing platforms.

In addition to image and video posts, Blixt supports rich media sharing via the GIPHY API, customizable user profiles (with avatars, bios, and privacy controls), and tools like user blocking and content moderation. The app also supports direct messaging and group chats, enabling real-time communication and community engagement within the platform.

Built with a fast React + Vite frontend and a scalable Node.js + PostgreSQL backend (leveraging Prisma ORM and Supabase for auth and storage), Blixt delivers a seamless, mobile-friendly experience designed for sharing, discovery, and staying connected in the moment. Images are stored on the cloudservice cloudinary
