Note that the project spins down with inactivity, so it might take 50 seconds before everything is running

## 📌 Project Overview

Blixt is a modern, full-stack social media web application that replicates the core functionality of Instagram, while adding powerful enhancements for a rich user experience. Users can share photos, videos, and GIFs, interact through likes and comments, follow each other, and personalize their profiles—making Blixt a sleek and social alternative to traditional photo-sharing platforms.

In addition to image and video posts, Blixt supports rich media sharing via the GIPHY API, customizable user profiles (with avatars, bios, and privacy controls), and tools like user blocking and content moderation. The app also supports direct messaging and group chats, enabling real-time communication and community engagement within the platform.

Built with a fast React + Vite frontend and a scalable Node.js + PostgreSQL backend (leveraging Prisma ORM and Supabase for auth and storage), Blixt delivers a seamless, mobile-friendly experience designed for sharing, discovery, and staying connected in the moment.
